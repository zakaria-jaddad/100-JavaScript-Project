1 : when the user is writing the submit button should be black 
    - when they press it it turns to Purple

2 : input should be like this DD MM YYYY
    - if there is nothing in the inputs user should see output like this 
        '-- Day'
        '-- Month'
        '-- Year'
    - fields are required obviously

3 : 
    - Days Input should be around 30 and 31, and 29
    - Month input should be around 0 and 12
    - years input should not be in the future



// this is the new algorithm for getting user living age

    User input date could be either 


        -> greater than current date
            -> the given date by the users after first checking 
                - for days in each month 
                    -> the given day could be either bigger or less then the current date
        -> lower than current date 
                - for days in each month 
                    -> the given day could be either bigger or less then the current date

so my approach is that i want to check if the user Date 

    -> if user Date is lower then the current date 

        -  the starting point would be user Date 

    -> if current date is lower then user date

        - starting point would be the user Date 


    -> for the day number 
        -> user date day number could be either 

            - > lower then current date day number 

                -> a month would be counted 

            - > greater then current date day number 

                -> a month wouldn't be counted
