/* 
    ther is an approach but it's too slow and i dont wanna write much code 
        -> make an dic json datatype and store each month how many days it got 
        -> then each time when user give a month check from the dic and give how many days are 
    But i don't wann write all month i mean am i crazy!!

    another approach is if ther is a method that give back days of each month.
    here is waht i got 

    this dude wants me to write all of that, is he crazy!
    no i'm not gonna do that
