1 So first is the design 
    - using HTML and css make a design to the Hangman game 

2 JS Logic 
    - get an API that gives each time a word 
        - get it and turn it to array 

            - ?? how can i make it offline  ??
            --> i can achive that by making a file that has all dictionary words 
            --> then open it and turn to an array and get a random word from it 
            --> but ther is a down side for this wich is the file SIZE....


            --> another approach is to make a json file 

        - also each word it's length should be more than 8 ''characters''
        - get all it's chars 
    - make a long string that containes all English chars
        - now i have to strings (the word, Alphabetical content) 
        ?? how can i get random chars from both but, i should get all content of the of the word String  ??
        - store all chars in an array, then add them to the document.
